# Deep-coReg
Deep-coReg is a deep unsupervised learning model for multimodal CT/MR co-registration i.e. the registration of a patient's CT scan on its own MR image. It works for both affine and deformable transformation models, and also can be mixed. Such a model can play a vital role in many medical Image-Guided Interventions (IGIs).
